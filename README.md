# Purpose of the project

The project was inspired by the groundbreaking astroparticle experiment named Radio Neutrino Observatory (RNO-G) that is under construction at summit station in Greenland. 

The aim of this project is to achive familiarity with radio signals and discerning their properties in order to investigate properly radio sources in the detection range. In my case the field of study is my office in DESY, where a radio antenna like the ones in Greenland (and the ones used for the previous ARIANNA experiment) is exposed.
This antenna is the receiver of the signals from sources surrounding my office. It was my interest to exploit this opportunity to get familiar with analysis of radio waveforms and their frequency spectrum. The goal is to be able to filter out narrow frequeny band signals without affecting the signal overimposed. 

> **Physics motive:** At the summit station signals overlapping can have different sources, but the interesting one is the emission generated from neutrinos interacting with the naturally present thick and cold ice in the field. The emission is a coherent cone-shaped electromagnetic field traking the energy of the particle shower that generated it

# Approach
There are two types of sources, broad-spectrum sources and narrow-spectrum sources. The formers are naturally occurrent physical phenomenas and the latters are artificial physical phenomenas. Background noise is dominated bu low-frequency, typically broad-spectrum signals that reach the heighest magnitudes detected.
Since the purpose of the study are high-frequency signals, those represent an obstacle for amplitude resolution reachable by the instrumentation. Therefore high-pass filters will be employed to clear the waveform from unwanted signals.
